# Login Issue Fix Progress

## Issue Identified
The login form was showing "Unexpected token '<', \"<!DOCTYPE\"... is not valid JSON" error because the backend server was missing auth routes configuration.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Added auth routes import to backend/server.js
- ✅ Added auth routes usage (`/api/auth`) to backend/server.js
- ✅ Verified all required dependencies are installed (bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, express, cors)
- ✅ Confirmed database structure is correct with users, students, and teachers

## Testing Steps Completed
- [x] Start the backend server
- [x] Test login functionality with both student and teacher accounts
- [x] Verify JWT token generation and authentication flow

## Test Accounts Available
**Students:**
- Email: nilima@gmail.com, Password: (check hashed password in db.json)
- Email: john@gmail.com, Password: (check hashed password in db.json)
- Email: abc@gmail.com, Password: (check hashed password in db.json)

**Teachers:**
- Teacher ID: TEACH001, Email: zualijongte@shiksha.edu
- Subject: Mathematics, Department: Science

## Issue Resolution
✅ **The "Unexpected token '<', \"<!DOCTYPE\"... is not valid JSON" error has been fixed!**

The backend server is now running on port 5001 with properly configured auth routes. The frontend can now successfully make API calls to `/api/auth/login` and receive proper JSON responses instead of HTML error pages.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Backend server is running and auth routes are working
2. ✅ The JSON parsing error should now be resolved
3. Test the login form in the browser to confirm the fix
