# TODO: Clear Form Fields After Signup/Login

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Modified SignupForm.js to clear form data (name, email, phone, password, confirmPassword) and errors after successful registration
- [x] Modified LoginForm.js to clear form data (role, name, password) and errors after successful login
- [x] Modified AuthContainer.js to force remount and reset forms on logout to ensure clean state

## Summary
The forms now clear all input fields and errors immediately after successful signup or login, preventing any previous values from persisting. On logout, the login form is remounted with cleared fields.
